Through simulating correlated ordinal data, this independent study project aims to and evaluate how to best assess the relationships between dose and neurodegeneration damage scores using Type I error rates and statistical power to compare and assess various statistical tests such as the Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallist test and Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test.
By systematically examining the effects of chemicals on neuron degeneration, this report seeks to contribute to assessment of the power of statistical tests in terms of type I and type II errors in non-parametric modeling of ordinal data, but also our understanding of the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and ultimately pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies and preventive measures.
